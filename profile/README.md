## Hi there 👋

We’re **Agenticify** — building AI-powered tools that improve developer productivity and code quality.

### 🙋‍♀️ What we’re about
- **AI-assisted code review** with repo context (not generic feedback)
- **DevEx automation** that helps teams ship faster and safer
- Practical, engineer-first tooling (clean output, actionable suggestions)

### 🌈 How to get involved
We love contributions! Here’s the easiest way to start:
1. **Open an issue** for bugs / feature requests
2. **Start a discussion** for ideas and questions
3. **Submit a PR** (small improvements are welcome)

> Please keep PRs focused and include a short “why” + “what changed”.

### 👩‍💻 Useful resources
- 🌐 Website: **agenticify.io**
- 📌 Repos: check pinned projects on our organization page
- 🧾 Docs: see each repo’s README (we’re improving docs continuously)

### 💜 Sponsors
If you’d like to support ongoing maintenance and new features, you can sponsor us via the **Sponsor** button on our repos.

### 🍿 Fun facts
We run on **coffee**, **PR diffs**, and the occasional “one more small refactor” 😄
